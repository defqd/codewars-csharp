8 kyu 

In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

Examples
Kata.MakeNegative(1);  // return -1
Kata.MakeNegative(-5); // return -5
Kata.MakeNegative(0);  // return 0
Notes
The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.
